# Pippi: Computer music with python

v2.0.0 - Beta 4 (In Development)

## What is this?

Pippi is a computer music system that aims to let you write python scores for offline rendering. 
`astrid` is the experimental kinda-realtime counterpart to `pippi` -- a DAW/live-coding environment 
for performance and interactive applications.

## Installation

Pippi requires python 3.6+ which can be found here:

    https://www.python.org/downloads/

The 3.5.x branch of python might work too, but is untested.

To use the most recent release from pip (currently `2.0.0 beta 3`) just:

    pip install pippi

## Tutorials

There are annotated example scripts in the `tutorials` directory which introduce some of pippi's functionality.

Beyond arriving at a good-enough stable API for the 2.x series of releases (and fixing bugs), my goal during the 
beta phase of development is to deal with the lack of documentation for this project.

## Install from source

To install the most recent development version, first install python deps:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

(This is usually done inside a virtualenv via something like `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate` but that's up to you.)

Make sure you have the submodule for Paul Batchelor's `Soundpipe` library checked out:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

CD into the `Soundpipe` directory and install Soundpipe:

    make
    sudo make install

CD back into the parent directory and build pippi's cython extensions:

    make build

Please let me know if you run into problems!

## To run tests

    make test

In many cases, this will produce a soundfile in the `tests/renders` directory for the corresponding test. (Ear-driven regression testing...)
During the beta I like to keep failing tests in the main repo, so... most tests will be passing but if they *all* are passing, probably you are living in the future and are looking at the first stable release.

## Clean build files

If you're hacking on pippi itself, during development you will sometimes need to build the cython modules completely from scratch. 
The normal `make build` command will by default only build the extensions whose source files have changed. That usually works fine, but 
to clean all the build files first just run:

    make clean

## Release Notes

### 2.0.0 - Beta 4

#### Features

- Removed all the old examples and wrote the first tutorial script.
- The first set of soundpipe modules are now available via the `fx` module!
    - `fx.lpf`, `fx.hpf`, `fx.bpf`, and `fx.brf` butterworth filters.
    - `fx.compressor`... a compressor.
    - `fx.mincer` a phase vocoder with independent control over pitch and speed.
    - `fx.paulstretch`... paulstretch.
    - `fx.saturator` a saturation distortion.
- A new `Waveset` datatype for Trevor Wishart-style microsound synthesis and easy creation of wavetable stacks for 2d oscs. Featuring:
    - Waveset substitution
    - Waveset normalization
    - Waveset harmonic distortion (in progress)
    - Waveset transposition (in progress)
    - Waveset morphing (in progress)
    - Waveset inversion (in progress)
- Broke oscs up into smaller units and added a few new ones consisting of:
    - `Osc` which is a simple wavetable osc
    - `Osc2d` a simple 2d wavetable osc
    - `Pulsar` a pulsar synthesis implementation (now with pulsewidth modulation!)
    - `Pulsar2d` the same which accepts optional wavetable stacks for the wavetable and window params
    - `Fold` an implementation of an infinite wavetable folder
    - `Pluck` a basic implementation of a plucked string physical model which can be fed with an arbitrary wavetable impulse
    - `DSS` an implementation of dynamic stochastic synthesis (in progress)
- Total rewrite of `grains.GrainCloud`, now `grains.Cloud` (and `SoundBuffer.cloud`)
    - Uses `mincer` for pitch shifting
    - Grainlength and grain density are no longer tightly coupled: no more `density` param. It is replaced with a `grainlength` value/wavetable and a `grid` value/wavetable.
    - Grain masking
- Many params can be given as either a fixed-value float (like `1.3`), a built-in wavetable flag (like `dsp.HANNOUT` or `dsp.RND`), or a wavetable-like object (a list, numpy array, sound buffer, etc). EG a cloud frozen in time `Cloud(position=0.75)`, advancing linearly through time `Cloud(position=dsp.PHASOR)`, or interpolated through four points in time `Cloud(position=[0, 1, 0.25, 0.75])`.
- A simple envelope follower interface on `SoundBuffer` which produces a `Wavetable` via `SoundBuffer.toenv()`, also available as `fx.envelope_follower()`
- A `SoundBuffer`-to-`Wavetable` shortcut via `SoundBuffer.towavetable()`

#### Bugfixes

- Some cython extension packaging improvements

### 2.0.0 - Alpha 9

Final feature releases / big api changes before going to beta.

- Breaking changes:
    - Durations for most APIs are now given in seconds (floats) rather than 
      integer frames. `len(SoundBuffer)` still returns a length in frames per
      python convention, and slicing into a `SoundBuffer` is also still done by frame
      (and channel) but there is a new `SoundBuffer.dur` property to get duration 
      in seconds as well.
    - Wavetables are no longer specified with string names, instead built-in 
      flags which are available on both the `wavetable` and `dsp` modules are 
      used. Eg to apply a sinewave envelop: `sound.env(dsp.SINE)` instead of `sound.env('sine')`. 
      The wavetypes available are `SINE`, `COS`, `TRI`, `SAW` (which is also aliased to 
      `PHASOR`), `RSAW` (reverse sawtooth), `HANN`, `HAMM`, `BLACK` or `BLACKMAN`, 
      `BART` or `BARTLETT`, `KAISER`, `SQUARE`, and the `RND` flag to select one at random.
- `Osc` changes:
    - Added 2d wavetable synthesis (similar to max/msp `2d.wave~`) to `Osc` plus example script
    - To create a 2d `Osc`, use the `stack` keyword arg on initialization: `Osc(stack=[dsp.RND, [0,1], dsp.SINE], lfo=dsp.SINE)`
    - `Osc` wavetables may be:
        - an int flag for standard wavetables (`dsp.SINE`, `dsp.TRI`, etc)
        - a python list of floats (`[0,1,0.5,0.3]`)
        - a wavetable (`wavetables.Wavetable([0,1,0,1])`)
        - a soundbuffer (`soundbuffer.SoundBuffer(filename='something.flac')`)
    - 2d wavetable stacks are a python list of any combination of the above.
    - The same types are acceptable for:
        - `wavetable` (the basic waveform)
        - `window` (an optional window to apply to the waveform wavetable - useful for eg pulsar synthesis)
        - `mod` (the frequency modulation wavetable)
        - and `lfo` (the 2d modulation wavetable)
- `SoundBuffer` changes:
    - Added `remix` for remixing a soundbuffer from N channels to N channels.
    - Panning algorithms operate on arbitrary numbers of channels (but use same algorithms applied to odd & even numbered channels instead of left & right)
    - Return a reversed copy of a soundbuffer with `sound.reversed()` or reverse in place with `sound.reverse()`
    - New ADSR envelopes with `sound.adsr(a=1, d=1, s=0.5, r=1)`
    - Generate a `GrainCloud` from a `SoundBuffer` with `sound.cloud()`
    - Clip samples to min/max with `sound.clip(minval=-1, maxval=1)`
    - Taper ends of sounds (linear fade-in, fade-out) with `sound.taper(length)`
- ADSR wavetable generator with `wavetables.adsr(a=100, d=100, s=0.5, r=100, 1024)`
- New `Wavetable` type for `SoundBuffer`-like operator-overloaded wavetable manipulation & composition
- New `GrainCloud` wavetable-driven granulator. See the `examples/swarmy_graincloud.py` example for more.
- `GrainCloud`-driven pitch shift without time change (`sound.transpose(speed)`) 
   and time stretch without pitch shift (`sound.stretch(length)`) methods for `SoundBuffer`.
- `dsp.cloud(SoundBuffer, *args, **kwargs)` shortcut for `GrainCloud` creation.
- Read wavetables from 1 channel sound files with `wavetables.fromfile`
- Added a simple helper for async rendering with `multiprocessing.Pool`
- `SoundBuffer`s can now be pickled (enables passing them between processes)
- `SoundBuffer` can be initialized (and spread across channels) from a normal python list


### 2.0.0 - Alpha 6-8

This was meant to be a feature-only release, to add the final round of features 
before going into beta / bugfix mode. Instead I switched from using numpy arrays directly 
to a first pass of a more general typed memoryview approach, and moved some more things into 
cython.

Also, hoo boy was `pip install pippi` ever *broken*.
It should be working now.

### 2.0.0 - Alpha 5

Bugfix release. Fixed an idiotic regression in `SoundBuffer`.

### 2.0.0 - Alpha 4

New in alpha 4:

- More speed improvements!
- Linear interpolation option for pitch shifting
- Pulsar synthesis with `Osc`
- Support for importing Scala `.scl` tuning files (Mapping file support coming later...)
- Waveform visualization with `graph.waveform`
- `SoundBuffer.fill` returns a copy of the sound instead of altering it in place
- `Sampler` abstraction for `Osc`-like treatment of samples and banks of samples

### 2.0.0 - Alpha 3

Optimizations and improvements in this release:

- Much better performance for wavetable and granular synthesis
- Improvements and additions to the `rhythm` modules
    - Better handling of `rhythm.curve` which now takes a length param instead of an obscure combination of multipliers
    - `rhythm.curve` can now be provided a custom wavetable
    - Added MPC swing helper for onset lists (via `rhythm.swing`)
    - Added a euclidean rhythm generator `rhythm.eu`
    - Added a pattern generation helper `rhythm.pattern`
    - Added pattern-to-onset and string-to-pattern helpers
        - Patterns are the same as pippi 1 (I may even just port some code) and can be in a few forms:
            - String literals with ascii notation eg: 'xx x- x' which is the same as 'xx.x-.x'
            - Lists of 'truthy' and 'falsey' values eg: ['1', True, 0, False] which is the same as 'xx..'
- Misc bugfixes:
    - Fix `random` param for `wavetable.window` and `wavetable.window`
    - Fix bad params for `wavetable.window` and `wavetable.window` -- falls back to sine in both cases

### 2.0.0 - Alpha 2

This release includes a few missing pieces to core functionality including:

- A crude squarewave wavetype for the wavetable osc!
- Custom wavetables for the wavetable osc and window/wavetable generators! 
  See the `simple_custom_wavetable.py` example for use with the wavetable osc.
- A simple non-interpolating `speed` method on `SoundBuffer` for pitch shifting sounds
- A set of rhythm helpers in the `rhythm` module useful for constructing onset / timing lists.
    - `rhythm.curve` which lets you map any of the window types to a list of onsets -- check out 
    the `simple_snare_bounce.py` example in the examples directory.
- Some more example scripts including:
    - `simple_snare_bounce.py` Demoing the `rhythm.curve` helper
    - `multi_snare_bounce.py` A more interesting variation on the snare bounce example
    - `simple_custom_wavetable.py` Showing a user-defined wavetable used with `Osc`
    - `synth_chords.py` Using the `tune` module with `Osc` to create a simple chord progression

### 2.0.0 - Alpha 1

This is the initial alpha release of pippi 2 -- which is very barebones at the moment, 
but already pretty functional!

Beware: the behavior of core functionality and features will probably change throughout the 
alpha releases of pippi 2. I'll try to document it here in the release notes.

This release provides:

- SoundBuffer abstraction for reading/writing soundfiles and doing basic operations on sounds.
- Osc abstraction for simple wavetable synthesis.
- Initial set of built-in wavetables for windowing (sine, triangle, saw, inverse saw) 
  and synthesis (sine, cosine, triangle, saw inverse saw)
- Set of panning algorithms and other built-in sound operations like addition, subtraction, 
  multiplication, mixing (and operater-overloaded mixing via `sound &= sound`), dubbing, 
  concatenation.
- A small set of helpers and shortcuts via the `dsp` module for loading, mixing, and concatenating (via `dsp.join`) sounds.
- Basic granular synthesis and wavetable synthesis examples.
