# Pippi Tutorials

In this directory you'll find some tutorial documents created with `pweave`. The source code for the tutorial files have a file extension ending in `.pmd`. 

Audio output from the tutorials is pre-rendered and stored in the `renders` directory for inline embedding in the generated HTML documents.

But who cares!? Click one of the links below to view a tutorial in your browser (if you're looking at this on github). 

Each tutorial has a corresponding python script, which is just all the source code bits extracted into a script that you can run on your computer to play around with the examples.
